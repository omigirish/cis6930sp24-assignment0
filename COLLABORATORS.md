The following web sources helped me build my project:

1. **SQLite3 Documentation**: The [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) available on the official Python website for the SQLite3 module provided invaluable guidance on incorporating SQLite databases into Python applications. With clear explanations and examples, it facilitated the effective implementation of database functionalities.

2. **PyPDF Documentation**: Referring to the [PyPDF documentation](https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) proved essential in understanding the capabilities and usage of the PyPDF module. It provided insights into parsing PDF files and extracting relevant information, enriching the project's functionality.

3. **Stack Overflow**: The vibrant community on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) served as a valuable resource for troubleshooting and resolving various technical challenges encountered during the project's development. Leveraging collective expertise, I overcame hurdles and implemented additional functionalities to enhance the project.

4. **ChatGPT**: Assistance from ChatGPT was instrumental in clarifying Python-related concepts and addressing logical queries arising during development. Its clear explanations and guidance significantly contributed to problem-solving efforts.

5. **urllib Documentation**: The [urllib documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) provided essential guidance on parsing URLs and handling web-related tasks within Python applications. Leveraging this documentation, I effectively utilized urllib for accessing and processing web content in the project.

6. **MDN Regular Expressions Cheatsheet**: I utilized the [MDN Regular Expressions Cheatsheet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions/Cheatsheet) to learn about regular expressions and their syntax. This knowledge was then applied in the project to define and refine regular expressions for parsing and extracting specific patterns from text data, enhancing the project's data processing capabilities.

7. **regexr.com**: I utilized [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/) to experiment with different regular expressions and deepen my understanding of their functionality. By testing various regex patterns and observing their behavior in real-time, I gained practical insights into crafting effective regex for text processing tasks within the project.
